# Project_Management
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Reporting Adverse Drug Events to FDI" project, a comprehensive showcase of project management principles and methodologies. In this coursework project, I served as the project manager and led a team through the entire project lifecycle, implementing Agile methodology and best practices.

Key Highlights:

Agile Methodology: We embraced Agile practices to ensure adaptability, collaboration, and customer-centric development throughout the project.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): We created a prioritized Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to systematically break down project tasks and ensure efficient task management.

Budget Considerations: Our project included discussions on budget considerations, ensuring that financial resources were allocated effectively and efficiently.

Risk Analysis: We conducted a thorough risk analysis to identify and mitigate potential challenges, ensuring a smooth project execution.

Gantt Charts: To facilitate seamless progress tracking and continuous work updates, we implemented Gantt charts, providing a visual timeline of project milestones and tasks.

This repository contains project documentation, reports, Agile artifacts, Gantt charts, and other relevant materials that showcase our project management journey. Explore our project management practices and methodologies, and gain insights into effective project management in the field of informatics.
